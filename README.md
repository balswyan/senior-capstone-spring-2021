Real Time Mask Control Identification Model for Government Control Enforcement

Project by: Bandr AlSwyan and Rempee Kalia

Abstract:

The purpose of this capstone project is to give the governments, police enforcement law and authority the tool to identify and potentially assist locating individuals who are in falls of wearing medical face mask in the time of crisis and such COVID-19. The need for this technology arises in its simplicity as there is no current application available out there or they are either complex or not modern enough to provide the complete potential and use with the right reach. The use of a simple tool that does not require prior knowledge is the goal that we want to achieve here. we will apply and support our application with huge dataset collected to train the model that will reflect better understanding of the application thinks and interact.
